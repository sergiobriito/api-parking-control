# API - Garage Parking Management

SpringBoot API for garage parking management and user registration, using Java, JPA, PostgreSQL. The project involved the creation of a secure user registration and authentication system, as well as the implementation of garage parking control functionalities. Throughout the project, I gained experience in Java, Spring, JPA, and PostgreSQL, as well as skills in design patterns such as Controllers, Services, and Repositories.
